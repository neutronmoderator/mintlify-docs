# Why Boundless?

Traditionally, blockchains rely on a "global re-execution" model, where every node redundantly processes every transaction to achieve consensus on the network's state. While this model is secure and transparent, it creates a fundamental constraint: the network is limited by the slowest node. This means the collective computational capacity of all nodes is underutilized. The result is that blockchains can only handle simple computations, with anything complex becoming too expensive or hitting gas limits.

## The Solution: Decoupling Execution From Consensus

Boundless transforms this model using zero-knowledge proofs. Instead of being limited by the slowest node, the network can harness the total collective capacity of all nodes. Each node generates execution proofs that any blockchain can verify without re-execution. The underlying networks maintain their security and consensus while eliminating redundant computation.

Boundless enables abundant compute on any blockchain by leveraging a decentralized market to handle complex computations and generate succinct, reusable proofs. These proofs, verified onchain, act as building blocks for innovation while driving efficiency through aggregation as demand grows. With each new prover on the market adding capacity and each new application amplifying benefits, the network strengthens and scales, creating a self-reinforcing system of increasing computational power and efficiency.
