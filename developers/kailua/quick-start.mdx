# Quick Start

:::note[Reminders]
- **OP Kailua** enables rollup operators to add a new fault proof system to their rollup via the Optimism `DisputeGameFactory`
contract.
 - **OP Kailua's** contracts rely on ZK proofs to finalize/dismiss output proposals, and are compatible with
Optimism's Bedrock contracts `v1.4.0` and above.

This tutorial will run you through on how to spin up a local OP Kailua devnet for development purposes.

Before you get started, you will need the following dependencies installed:

- [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [just](https://just.systems/man/en/)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [svm](https://github.com/alloy-rs/svm-rs)
- [foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)

## Clone the Kailua repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/risc0/kailua.git && cd kailua
```

## Run the following commands to spin up a devnet

You can deploy a local optimism devnet equipped with Kailua through the following commands:

1. `just devnet-fetch`
    * Fetches `v1.9.1` of the `optimism` monorepo.
2. `just devnet-build`
    * Builds the local cargo and foundry projects.
3. `just devnet-up`
    * Starts a local OP Stack devnet using docker.
    * Dumps the output into `devnetlog.txt` for inspection.
4. `just devnet-upgrade`
    * Upgrades the devnet to use the `KailuaGame` contract.
    * Assumes the default values of the local optimism devnet, but can take parameters.
5. `just devnet-propose`
    * Launches the Kailua proposer.
    * This runs the sequences, which periodically creates new `KailuaGame` instances.
6. `just devnet-validate`
    * Launches the Kailua validator.
    * This monitors `KailuaGame` instances for disputes and creates proofs to resolve them.
    * (VALIDITY PROVING) Use `just devnet-validate [block-height]` to generate validity proofs to fast-forward finality until the specified L2 block height.
    * (DEVELOPMENT MODE): Use `RISC0_DEV_MODE=1` to use fake proofs.
7. `just devnet-fault`
    * Deploys a single `KailuaGame` instance with a faulty sequencing proposal.
    * Tests the validator's fault proving functionality.
    * Tests the proposer's canonical chain tracking functionality.
8. After you're done:
    * `just devnet-down` to stop the running docker containers.
    * `just devnet-clean` to cleanup the docker volumes.
