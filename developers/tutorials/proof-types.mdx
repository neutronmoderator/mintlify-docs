## Default: Merkle Inclusion Proofs

By default, Boundless delivers proofs on-chain as merkle inclusion proofs:

1. Proofs are batched together are aggregated into a single Groth16 proof.
2. The aggregated proof is verified once on-chain
3. Individual proofs are verified through cheap merkle inclusion proofs into this root

This design is what makes Boundless cost-effective for on-chain verification.

## Requesting a specific proof type

While merkle inclusion proofs are efficient for on-chain verification, there may be cases where you need to access the underlying proof instead of a merkle inclusion proof. For example:

1. Cross-chain verification where you need to verify the proof on a different chain
2. Integration with other systems that expect a specific proof type
3. Custom verification logic that requires the full proof

Boundless supports requesting a raw Groth16 proof instead of a merkle inclusion proof. You can specify this in your proof request by setting the `proof_type` to `ProofType::Groth16`:

```rust
# use alloy_primitives::utils::parse_ether;
# use boundless_market::{Client, request_builder::OfferParams};
# use url::Url;
# async fn create_groth16_request(
#     client: Client,
#     program: &'static [u8],
#     input: &[u8]
# ) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
let request = client.new_request()
    .with_program(program)
    .with_stdin(input)
    .with_groth16_proof()  // Request raw Groth16 proof
    .with_offer(
        OfferParams::builder()
            .min_price(parse_ether("0.001")?)
            .max_price(parse_ether("0.002")?)
            .timeout(1000)
            .lock_timeout(1000)
    );
# Ok(())
# }
```

## Considerations

When choosing between proof types, consider:

1. **Gas Costs**
   - Merkle inclusion proofs are much cheaper to verify on-chain
   - Raw Groth16 proofs require full SNARK verification each time. This will increase the price of the proof

2. **Use Case Requirements**
   - If you only need on-chain verification, use the default merkle inclusion proof
   - If you need cross-chain verification or raw proof data, use Groth16
   - If you need to compose the proof by verifying it within another zkVM guest program, use Groth16

## Example: Proof Composition using Proof Types

In the [Proof Composition example](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/tree/main/examples/proof-composition), we demonstrate how to compose a proof from multiple proofs.

Composing a proof requires us to verify a previously generated Groth16 proof within the zkVM guest program. This requires us to request a raw Groth16 proof from the Boundless Market.


In the composition example, we first request a raw Groth16 proof from the Boundless Market using the `ECHO` guest program.

```rust
# use alloy_primitives::utils::parse_ether;
# use boundless_market::{Client, request_builder::OfferParams};
# use url::Url;
# async fn create_groth16_request(
#     client: Client,
#     program: &'static [u8],
#     input: &[u8]
# ) -> anyhow::Result<()> {
let request = client.new_request()
    .with_program(program)
    .with_stdin(input)
    .with_groth16_proof()  // Request raw Groth16 proof
    .with_offer(
        OfferParams::builder()
            .min_price(parse_ether("0.001")?)
            .max_price(parse_ether("0.002")?)
            .timeout(1000)
            .lock_timeout(1000)
    );
# Ok(())
# }
```

We then provide the Groth16 proof as input to the `IDENTITY` zkVM guest program, and verify the proof.

```rust
use risc0_zkvm::guest::env;
use risc0_zkvm::{Digest, Receipt};

fn main() {
    let (image_id, receipt): (Digest, Receipt) = env::read();
    let claim = receipt.claim().unwrap();
    receipt.verify(image_id).unwrap();
    ....
}
```
