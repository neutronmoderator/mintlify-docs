## Overview

`boundless` is a command-line interface for interacting with the Boundless Market, specifically designed to help requestors and provers with common interactions

## Installation

<Note>
The Boundless CLI source code can be found at [boundless/crates/boundless-cli](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/tree/main/crates/boundless-cli).
</Note>

You'll need to [install Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html), then you can run the following command to install the CLI.

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless boundless-cli --branch release-1.1 --bin boundless
```

## Overview

### What is a module?

Once installed, simply running `boundless` gives a helpful overview:

![Boundless CLI](/images/boundless_cli_main.png)

The CLI has three main modules:

- [Requestor Module](/developers/tooling/cli#requestor): Commands for submitting proof requests
- [Prover Module](/developers/tooling/cli#prover): Commands for locking, executing, proving and fulfilling proof requests
- [Rewards Module](/developers/tooling/cli#rewards): Commands for staking and delegating $ZKC, claiming staking and mining rewards, seeing recent rewards and more.

### Module setup

Each module has a respective interactive `setup` command which allows you to store *(in plaintext!)* variables such as relevant RPC URLs, private keys etc:

```bash
boundless <MODULE> setup
```

These setup commands store secrets in the `~/.boundless/` directory. Any further command calls will first check this location for the relevant secrets, otherwise it will check the flags passed directly to the command.

### Command help pages

For a detailed help page for a specific command, run the command with the `--help` flag, for example:

```bash
boundless prover deposit-collateral --help
```

which will detail all the relevant options annd mandatory flags:

```bash
Usage: boundless prover benchmark [OPTIONS] --request-ids <REQUEST_IDS>

Options:
      --request-ids <REQUEST_IDS>
          Proof request ids to benchmark

  -h, --help
          Print help (see a summary with '-h')

Prover:
      --prover-rpc-url <PROVER_RPC_URL>
          RPC URL for the prover network

          [env: PROVER_RPC_URL=]

      --prover-private-key <PRIVATE_KEY>
          Private key for prover transactions

          [env: PROVER_PRIVATE_KEY]

...
```

## Requesting a Proof via the Boundless CLI

In early testing, and when trying out new order parameters, it can be useful to submit a request via the Boundless CLI.

The Boundless CLI builds upon the [`boundless_market`](https://docs.rs/boundless-market/latest/boundless_market) library.
It covers multiple market interactions such as submitting proof requests, cancelling requests, executing dry runs, requesting the status of a given request, retrieving the journal and seal of a fulfilled request and verifying a proof.

To submit a proof, a valid `request.yaml` is required, this config file will specify the parameters of the request:

- Request ID
  - This can be specified, or if set to 0, a random ID will be assigned.
- Requirements:
  - The image ID of the program being proven.
  - The contents of the outputs of the program, the journal.
    This is to make sure the outputs are as expected (e.g., to ensure the right input was provided, by checking an input digest committed to the journal).
- Image URL
  - The link to the program stored on any public HTTP server.
    IPFS, used through a gateway, works well (Boundless will support IPFS URLs natively in the future).
- Input:
  - The input bytes are passed to the program for execution.
    The input can have any encoding. The bytes will be passed to the guest without modification.
- Offer:
  - This includes the minimum and maximum price for the proof request, the block number to open bidding, the price ramp up period, how many blocks before the request should timeout, and the lock-in stake the prover has to escrow to submit a bid.

Below is an example of a `request.yaml` file that can be used with the `boundless submit request` command.

```yaml request.yaml
# Unique ID for this request, constructed from the client address and a 32-bit index.
# Constructed as (address(client) << 32) | index
id: 0 # if set to 0, gets overwritten by a random id

# Specifies the requirements for the delivered proof, including the program that must be run,
# and the constraints on the journal's value, which define the statement to be proven.
requirements:
    imageId: "53cb4210cf2f5bf059e3a4f7bcbb8e21ddc5c11a690fd79e87947f9fec5522a3"
    predicate:
        predicateType: PrefixMatch
        data: "53797374"
    callback:
        addr: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
        gasLimit: 0
    selector: "00000000"

# A public URI where the program (i.e. image) can be downloaded. This URI will be accessed by
# provers that are evaluating whether to bid on the request.
imageUrl: "https://gateway.beboundless.cloud/ipfs/bafkreie5vdnixfaiozgnqdfoev6akghj5ek3jftrsjt7uw2nnuiuegqsyu"

# Input to be provided to the zkVM guest execution.
# The input data is a encoded guest environment.
# See crates/boundless-market/src/input.rs for additional details.
input:
    inputType: Inline
    data: "0181a5737464696edc003553797374656d54696d65207b2074765f7365633a20313733383030343939382c2074765f6e7365633a20363235373837303030207d"

# Offer specifying how much the client is willing to pay to have this request fulfilled
offer:
    minPrice: 100000000000000
    maxPrice: 2000000000000000
    rampUpStart: 0 # if set to 0, gets overwritten by the current UNIX timestamp
    rampUpPeriod: 300
    timeout: 3600 # 1 hor
    lockTimeout: 2700 # 45 minutes
    lockCollateral: 5000000000000000000 # 5 ZKC tokens
```

To submit a request, export or create a `.env` file with the following environment variables:

```bash Terminal
export RPC_URL="https://ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com"
export PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_SEPOLIA_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY"
```

Then run the following command:

```bash Terminal
RUST_LOG=info boundless request submit request.yaml
```

To wait until the submitted request has been fulfilled, the `--wait` option can be added:

```bash Terminal
# [!code word:--wait]
RUST_LOG=info boundless request submit request.yaml --wait
```

And to submit the request to the offchain order-stream service, make a deposit and then run `request submit` with `--offchain`.

```bash Terminal
# [!code word:--offchain]
RUST_LOG=info boundless account deposit 0.002 # Enough for the request above; deposit more to cover multiple requests.
RUST_LOG=info boundless request submit request.yaml --wait --offchain
```
