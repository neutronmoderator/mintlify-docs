## Mining Rewards

<Tip>
Claiming mining rewards requires *both* a valid archive node RPC endpoint and a Beacon Chain RPC endpoint.

In our testing, the Alchemy paid RPC plan in combination with the public beacon chain API URL (`https://ethereum-beacon-api.publicnode.com/`) works for claiming rewards. Quicknode works for the beacon chain endpoint, but Quicknode RPC endpoints are not recommended for `claim-mining-rewards` as it commonly errors with request rate limits.
</Tip>

After the reward epoch has finalized, mining rewards can be claimed with:

```bash
boundless rewards claim-mining-rewards
```

This process is permissionless and DOES NOT require the private key for the address eligible for the rewards. The only requirement is that the stored `PRIVATE_KEY` has enough funds to cover gas costs on Ethereum mainnet. `claim-mining-rewards` uses Bento for proving (see [claim.rs](https://github.com/boundless-xyz/boundless/blob/040645c9f91bc4804ba63c9b4744a5a21df0c90c/crates/boundless-cli/src/commands/povw/claim.rs#L244-L267)); therefore, make sure to have Bento running locally or specify a valid Bento API URL endpoint via `--bento-api-url`.

## Staking Rewards

After the reward epoch has finalized, staking rewards can be claimed with:

```bash
boundless rewards claim-staking-rewards
```

where `PRIVATE_KEY` is the private key of the address that has the [reward power](/zkc/mining/wallet-setup#stakes-zkc-and-receives-reward-power). This would be the private key for the rewards address when using the [recommended wallet setup](/zkc/mining/wallet-setup).

## Checking Details of Current Reward Epoch

If the reward epoch has not been finalized yet, provers can check details of the the current epoch:

```bash
boundless rewards epoch
```
