# The Boundless Proving Stack

## Overview

At the core of the Boundless proving stack is *Bento*, which fundamentally builds upon the [RISC Zero zkVM](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/). The Boundless team shipped *Bento* after 2+ years of operating a highly parallelized and highly performant remote proving cluster, known as [Bonsai](https://dev.risczero.com/api/generating-proofs/remote-proving). Bento encapsulates this practical experience and learnings into a stack built for the Boundless market. Bento scales from single GPU machines to large clusters which makes it ideal for provers in the Boundless protocol.

## What is Bento?

:::tip
For a deeper dive into Bento's technical design, components and configuration, please see [Bento Technical Design](/provers/bento).
:::

Bento is a semi multi-tenant proving cluster for the [RISC Zero zkVM](https://dev.risczero.com/api/zkvm/). Concretely, Bento is a Docker compose stack which contains all the services needed to run a Bento cluster. It is highly configurable, and features:

- [multi GPU support](/provers/performance-optimization#multiple-agents-and-gpus).
- multi machine support.
- support for proofs of any size.
- safe cache/storage for all proof data.
- a robust retry system.
- an API for proof management.

The [Prover Quick Start](/provers/quick-start) has information about getting started with Bento, a recommended initial configuration and how to run basic sample proof workloads.

## What is the Broker?

:::warning
For all provers, a collateral balance is necessary to be able to cover requirements for proof request lock-in. The Broker service provides a straightforward way to [deposit funds](/provers/broker#deposit-collateral-to-the-market) to the market.
:::

The [Broker](/provers/broker) is responsible for market interactions (see steps **2b.** and **4a.** in *Figure 1*) including evaluating requests to assign a price, bidding on requests to lock them, issuing proving requests to the Bento proving cluster, and submitting proof fulfillments onchain.
Broker configuration is primarily managed through the [`broker.toml`](/provers/broker#settings-in-brokertoml) file in the Boundless directory.

To get started with the Broker, please see the [Broker page](/provers/broker).

## How are Bento and the Broker related?

Bento is responsible for:

* the API for managing proof requests.
* queuing and scheduling proof requests.
* executing guest programs.
* running proving using the RISC Zero zkVM.
* aggregating proofs into the right format for the Boundless Market.

Bento is **not** responsible for interaction with the Boundless market.

The recommended service for market interaction for provers is the [Broker](/provers/broker) service. The Broker is responsible for both interacting with the Boundless Market i.e., bidding on and fulfilling proof requests *and* sending job requests to the Bento proving cluster.

:::note
As Bento is intended to be a drop in replacement for Bonsai, the Broker can run by sending requests either to Bento *or* to Bonsai.
